# AlirezaMahDev.Extensions.DataManager.Stack.Abstractions

## Project Description

This project is part of the AlirezaMahDev.Extensions ecosystem and is intended to provide abstract stack data structure implementations on top of the DataManager infrastructure. Currently, this project is in its initial stages and serves as a placeholder for future stack-related abstractions.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to define the core interfaces and contracts for stack data structures that will work with the underlying DataManager infrastructure, providing persistent and efficient stack operations.

## Project Status

⚠️ **Under Development**: This project is currently in the initial setup phase and does not contain any implementation. The interfaces and abstractions for stack operations will be added in future updates.

## Planned Features

- Stack data structure abstractions
- Thread-safe stack operations
- Integration with DataManager for persistence
- Support for various stack implementations
- Asynchronous operation support

## Dependencies

- **.NET 10.0**: Base framework requirements
- **AlirezaMahDev.Extensions.DataManager.Abstractions**: For data management interfaces

## Getting Started

This project is not yet ready for production use. Once implemented, usage examples will be provided here.
